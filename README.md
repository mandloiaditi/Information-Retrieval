All of the code is compiled into a single .py file 'main.py' with appropriate functions defined within.

To run the code:
command line:
1) If do not wish to plot and save images of the n-grams only need to give filename in argument.

python main.py filename 

2) To display the analysis along with displaying and saving of plot images give 1 in argument after filename.

python main.py filename 1
note: to keep the script running, need to manually close the figure windows popping up.
